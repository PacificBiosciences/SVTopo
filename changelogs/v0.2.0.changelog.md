# v0.2.0

`SVTopo`
* Generate BED file output to associate image regions with image filenames and variant IDs
* Replace `json-out` arg with required `svtopo-dir` arg for multi-file output
* Add `prefix` arg as sample identifier
* Add `verbose` argument for verbose debug logging as in svtopovz
* Sort output coordinates for output consistency
    * Applies to alignments and event graphs for both debug log and json output
* Improve identification of reads assigned to blocks by confidence interval
* Filter out regions where split alignments have low mapq
* Improve handling for clipping direction in coordinate merges
* Filter out event graphs that end with unspanned blocks (incomplete graphs)
* Improve the filtering of alignments assigned to a cluster location by only including those alignments that clip at the most common nearby clipping site
* Omit INS variant breakpoints from input VCF
* Extend default cluster confidence interval to 15 bp instead of 10. Extend further based on VCF-assigned alignment distance from cluster where necessary

`SVTopoVz`
* Change single-sample to one-or-many input method: remove `json` and `out-prefix` args, replace with single `svtopo-dir` argument. Allows running on any number of included output JSON/BED file pairs from SVTopo
* Emit warning if SVTopoVz version does not match SVTopo version
* By default, filter out nonreciprocal translocations
* Change `include-simple-dels` and `include-simple-dups` args to single `include-simple-breakpoints` arg, now also applies to non-reciprocal translocations
* Silence matplotlib.font_manager warning
* Add explicit padding to image xlimits if identical start/end (silences warning)
* Add GTF/GFF3 support and new annotation track for gene locations
* Decrease white space in images
* Add HTML viewer output for single or multi-sample visual review
* Add python unit tests
