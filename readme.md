<h4 align="center">Complex structural variant visualization for HiFi sequencing data</h3>

SVTopo represents complex structural variants (SVs) to enhance PacBio HiFi data analysis. SVTopo determines connections between SV breakends using VCF and aligned BAM inputs, performing best when paired with the [sawfish](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/sawfish) variant caller. SVTopo outputs connected breakends as JSON data and uses the SVTopoVz python utility to plot complex structural rearrangements as high-quality images.

Key Features (see [Result Interpretation](docs/result_interpretation.md) for more details):
* Top section: illustration of connected aligned sequences as blocks, showing order and orientation in the sample genome relative to the reference
  * Alignment support strength shown by block weight
  * Block sizes encoded into legend
* Optional gene annotations
* Bottom section: chained plot highlighting deletion, duplication, and inversion effects on rearranged genome structure

## Getting started
* See the [Getting started](docs/user_guide.md#getting-started) section in the [User Guide](docs/user_guide.md) to start using SVTopo
* There's help to understand the results at [Result interpretation](docs/result_interpretation.md)
* An example site of images from seven genomes is viewable at https://pacificbiosciences.github.io/SVTopo/
